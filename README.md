## Introduction

Bitchain is a simple lockchain emulator written in Python. Aimed at fostering education and understanding of blockchain technologies, Bitchain provides a clear and easy-to-understand interface to interact with a blockchain.

### Key Features

- **Block Creation**: Easily create new blocks with customizable data.
- **Transaction Handling**: Simulate transactions between parties in the blockchain.
- **Chain Validation**: Verify the integrity of the blockchain through hash calculations.
- **Persistence**: Keep a record of transactions until they are incorporated into a block.

## Installation

### Requirements

- Python 3.6 or higher
- Git (optional)

To install Bitchain, clone the repository using Git:

``` sh
git clone https://github.com/username/bitchain.git
cd bitchain
```

or:

``` sh
pip install bitchain
```

see: https://pypi.org/project/bitchain/

You can also download the source code as a zip file and extract it.

## Usage

Once you have the Bitchain code on your local machine, you can run it using Python:

``` sh
python3 main.py
```

Bitchain includes a `main` function that creates a simple blockchain, adds transactions to it, and prints out the entire chain.

## Example

Here's a quick example of creating a blockchain, adding transactions, and creating new blocks:

``` python
blockchain = Bitchain()

blockchain.new_transaction("Satoshi", "Mike", '5 BTC')
blockchain.new_transaction("Mike", "Satoshi", '1 BTC')
blockchain.new_transaction("Satoshi", "Hal Finney", '5 BTC')
blockchain.new_block(12345)

blockchain.new_transaction("Mike", "Alice", '1 BTC')
blockchain.new_transaction("Alice", "Bob", '0.5 BTC')
blockchain.new_transaction("Bob", "Mike", '0.5 BTC')
blockchain.new_block(6789)

print("Genesis block: ", blockchain.chain)
```

## Building

``` py
python3 -m pip install --upgrade build
python3 -m build
```

## Documentation

Please refer to the docstrings in the `Bitchain` class for detailed information on the functionality of each method.
